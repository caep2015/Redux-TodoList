# Redux-TodoList
The Iron Yard, React Week 4 Redux Part 2 In-Class Project

## Authoring a Reducer to filter data based on a user action

This project was created using create-react-app, so running yarn install and yarn start should be enough to get it running.
* We use our action creators to pass our action to our reducer via dispatch inside of the store.
* The reducer is a function that manipulates our state according to actions.
* We can use these to filter our data based off our application state.
* The workflow remains the same for all Redux/React applications and follows the cycle we have discussed.
